OBJECTS = $(patsubst src/%$(EXTENSION),bin/%.o,$(wildcard src/*$(EXTENSION)))# in bin/%.o format, all of the objects to be compiled
# previous line explained:
# patsubst replaces the first arg template with the second arg template on the variable in the third arg
# wildcard gets all the files that comply with its arg
# in this case wildcard returns every file with the main extension in the src directory
# e.g. src/main.cpp src/File1.cpp
# patsub replaces the src and the extension
# e.g. bin/main.o bin/File1/.o
